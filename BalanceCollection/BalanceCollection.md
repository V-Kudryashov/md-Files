## 1 Description

This asset contains several physics models that balance in a state of unstable equilibrium. All models balance naturally except Wheelie. In Wheelie's case I had to use magic force.

I tried to make the models and scripts as simple as possible. The controller scripts turned out to be very short and simple. These models and controllers can serve as a basis for your models.

The bike model consists of two WheelColliders and one Rigidbody. The controller script is very simple, but the formula for BalanceSteer requires some explanation.
